# Direct-Data-Driven-Predictive-Control-for-a-Three-dimensional-Cable-Driven-Soft-Robotic-Arm

## Overview
We design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform, we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory tracking in 3D space.
